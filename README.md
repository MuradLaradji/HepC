# HepC
Hepatitis C Project for Dr. Engy Ziedan @ Tulane Econ

This project sought to characterize the multi-generational hepatitis C epidemic in Egypt along demographic lines, and then to draw correlations on the microeconomic impacts of the epidemic. It used data gathered by the USAID Demographic Health Surveys and relied on scripts in r, SPSS, and arcGIS. The bulk of the work was done in r, with use of SPSS and arcGIS purely to mutate/gather new datasets to manipulate in r. 

Thanks to Dr. Engy Ziedan of course!
